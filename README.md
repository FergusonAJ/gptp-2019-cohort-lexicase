# Investigating Cohort Lexicase (Placeholder)
This repository holds the code behind our work for the 2019 Genetic Programming Theory and Practice (GPTP) conference. In this work we are further delving into why Cohort Lexicase Selection outperforms other similar selection techniques on some problems but not others. 

All code is modified and simplified from GECCO 2019 code by Alexander Lalejini and Jose Hernandez here:

Detailed description of the experiment and definition of Lexicase / Cohort Lexicase coming soon!
